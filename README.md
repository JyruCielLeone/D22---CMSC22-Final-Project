# D22---CMSC22-Final-Project
D22 - A dice roller app
You can roll up to 22 dice of the most commonly used tabletop dice
(d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) and add or subtract a modifier of up to 20.

I employed the Factory, Bridge, and Template methods as the design patterns.
I tried to follow the best practices regarding naming conventions, if-checks, 
declarations, assignments, and methods as closely as I can.
